# AXISBANKSOLUTION
The project we have built is based on SVM. We want to provide a simple program script in which one can upload a signature and match with the signatures already available in the datasets wich are currently being used for checking these things

**Features Used**

SIFT
Convex Hull area / Bounding Rectangle area
Aspect ratio of bounding rectangle
Countour area / Bounding Rectangle area
Perceptual hash of the image

**Model used**

Linear SVM 
Precision ~ 0.92
Recall - 1.0
